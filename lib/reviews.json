This feature used to save me plots of time but sadly is gone. I hope this feature can be integrated back soon, but overall the app is good, very professional.",

She is kind and genuine and so wonderful to reach out to if I have any questions or requests hehe ( let be ankle weights so much) With the app everything is laid out so well and I can pick and choose what I want to do for the day and for how long or which body part I want to focus on.  I also love that she gives us a weekly schedule to follow if we so chose.  I love her reformer workouts and mat workouts so much.  The recipes section is so well done and easy to follow.  Congrats Lisa on the app.  Forever grateful.",

# Navigation Updates

- The main navigation is now sticky/fixed at the top of the page, staying visible while users scroll
- Header starts transparent and transitions to a black background when user scrolls (with smooth animation)
- Header background change triggers after 10px of scrolling
- "Get Started" call-to-action button updated to white gradient design with black text for better visibility
- Main content area automatically adjusts its spacing to prevent content from hiding behind the fixed header
- Header component converted to client component to enable scroll-based interactions

# Type System Updates

  - Use flattened image array structure
  - Include isNew flag
  - Match the structure used in transforms.ts
- Updated ProductPage component to:
  - Work with flattened image array
  - Handle isNew badge display
  - Use correct image properties (url instead of originalSrc)

- Bidirectional transforms handle conversion between:
  - Nested Shopify image structure
  - Flat application image structure

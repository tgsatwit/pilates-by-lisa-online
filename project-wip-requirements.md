# Navigation Updates

- The main navigation is now sticky/fixed at the top of the page, staying visible while users scroll
- Header starts transparent and transitions to a black background when user scrolls (with smooth animation)
- Header background change triggers after 10px of scrolling
- "Get Started" call-to-action button updated to white gradient design with black text for better visibility
- Main content area automatically adjusts its spacing to prevent content from hiding behind the fixed header
- Header component converted to client component to enable scroll-based interactions
